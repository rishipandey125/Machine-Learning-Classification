# Machine Learning Classification
Machine Learning classification model implementing Random Forest algorithm, built in Python from scratch. Tested using the IRIS flower dataset.

Model generates decision trees, and saves them into a Random Forest Object. The object is tested for accuracy and scrapped if does not meet the minimum accuracy requirement parameter. Model is trained off of 60% of the datset, and tested using the other 40% it has never been exposed to. 

# Example 1: 
Model built with 96.72% accuracy. The first plot represents the actual species of certain flowers in the dataset, while the second is the Machine Learning predicted species. In red are the incorrect predictions. The model only predicted incorrectly twice in this example.
